# Factory Management & Automation
These games emphasize the building of assembly lines that consume input resources in order to produce output goods, often with multiple chains of inputs to intermediary outputs.

## Factory Building
This subcategory has games that involve building an actual factory, usually by manually mining resources first and then slowly adding automation.

# City Builders & Civil Engineering

These games have a primary focus on city building and utilities infrastructure (electricity, sewer, water, garbage, etc.). They are a typically blend of planning and economy management.

There is a separate category, Transportation, for games that primarily deal with route-building without the accompanying city and economy management.

## Modern & Near-Future
These take place in the modern, post-industrial era with modern vehicles and power grids.

* (2023) [Terra Nil](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1593030/Terra_Nil/) ‚òÅÔ∏è

* (2015) [Cities: Skylines](https://store.steampowered.com/app/255710/Cities_Skylines/) üëç ‚òÅÔ∏è
    * Curator's Choice: Probably the most in-depth city builder available today, even compared to its sequel (Cities Skylines 2). A great simulation of zoning, routing, economy management, hydrology, and more. If you play only one game on this entire list, make it this one!

## Rail & Sails
This is the pre-modern era, before open-sea shipping, trucks, and air freight were common. They have a focus on sailing craft, wagons & trains.

* (2019) [Anno 1800](https://store.steampowered.com/app/916440/Anno_1800/) ‚òÅÔ∏è


## Medieval & Fantasy
Before industrialization, or in alternate realities with a typical "old world" fantasy theme.

    * Curator's Choice: Build the Jurassic Park of your dreams, complete with genetically-modified supercarnivores, hyperloops, zip lines, and hotels.

# Survival & Settlement Builders, Colony Sims
Similar to city builders, but with a stronger focus on surviving harsh conditions and managing limited resources, heat/cold, food, etc. In this genre, individual citizens are often more important and impactful, and the simulation is more about the micro aspects of daily life than big-picture population growth.

    * Curator's Choice: Tough survival simulator in a frozen wasteland, with enough resource, route, heat and energy management to make it interesting to the engineer-minded.
* (2017) [Kingdoms and Castles](https://store.steampowered.com/app/569480/Kingdoms_and_Castles/)

# Open-World Survival Sandboxes
A sibling genre to colony sims, here you take direct control of one person (or a small group) to try to gather resources, craft, and survive. While they don't all have the strongest engineering focus, most have at least building & resource management aspects.

* (2020) [Empyrion - Galactic Survival](https://store.steampowered.com/app/383120/Empyrion__Galactic_Survival/) ‚òÅÔ∏è

* (2013) [7 Days to Die](https://store.steampowered.com/app/251570/7_Days_to_Die/) ‚òÅÔ∏è

# Bridge-Building
These games focus on building semi-realistic (or not) bridges over cliffs, rivers, etc. with physics simulation and load management. Different material strengths and stressors test your ability to build bridges that hold up under heavy use.

* (2023) [Poly Bridge 3](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1850160/Poly_Bridge_3/) ‚ù§Ô∏è
    * (2020) [Poly Bridge 2](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1062160) ‚ù§Ô∏è

    * (2014) [Bridge Constructor Medieval](https://store.steampowered.com/app/319850/Bridge_Constructor_Medieval/)


# Rube Goldberg Machines

These games replicate the "Incredible Machine" games of the 90s, where you build crazy contraptions out of everything from lasers to ballons to cats, then use them in humorous ways to complete puzzles.

* (2022) [World of Contraptions](https://store.steampowered.com/app/681640/World_of_Contraptions/)
* (2016) [Ultimate Chicken Horse](https://store.steampowered.com/app/386940/Ultimate_Chicken_Horse/) ‚ù§Ô∏è üëç ‚òÅÔ∏è
    * Curator's Choice: A competitive, multiplayer reimagining of the genre, where your contraptions become traps that foil other players (or yourself, if you're not careful)
* (2016) [Crazy Machines 3](https://store.steampowered.com/app/351920/Crazy_Machines_3/)
* (2014) [Contraption Maker](https://store.steampowered.com/app/241240/Contraption_Maker/)

# Hacking, Computer Science, Logic & Automation
These games have a focus on programming and automation. Unlike factory games, they focus on optimizing repeatable sets of actions rather than resource inputs. Some are graphical, while others require some light scripting/coding.

* (2021) [Bitburner](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1812820/Bitburner/) ‚ù§Ô∏è
* (2019) [while True: learn()](https://store.steampowered.com/app/619150/while_True_learn/)

# Job Simulators & Unique Themes
This is sort of a catch-all category for games that don't neatly fit anywhere else, usually with a creative take on some mundane (or exciting!) job.

## Ship Crews (Space or Naval)
* (2023) [Void Crew](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1063420/Void_Crew/) ‚òÅÔ∏è
